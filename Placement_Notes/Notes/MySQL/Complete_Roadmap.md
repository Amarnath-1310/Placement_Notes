# ✅ MySQL MASTER TOPIC LIST 
(**Learning → Placement → Developer**) 
Use this as a **checklist**, not a reading list. 
--- 
## 1️⃣ SQL BASICS (Learning Foundation) 
You must write these **without thinking**. 
### Data Definition 
* Database vs Schema 
* `CREATE DATABASE` 
* `USE` 
* `DROP DATABASE` 
### Tables 
* `CREATE TABLE` 
* `DESCRIBE` 
* `DROP TABLE` 
* `ALTER TABLE` 
* add / modify / drop columns 
### Data Types 
* `INT`, `BIGINT` 
* `VARCHAR`, `CHAR`, `TEXT` 
* `DATE`, `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP` 
* `DECIMAL` 
* `BOOLEAN` 
👉 **If data types confuse you, you’re not ready for joins.** 
--- 
## 2️⃣ CRUD OPERATIONS (Placement MUST) 
Interviewers assume this is trivial. 
* `INSERT` 
* `SELECT` 
* `UPDATE` 
* `DELETE` 
### Filtering & Sorting 
* `WHERE` 
* `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` 
* `IN`, `BETWEEN` 
* `LIKE` 
* `ORDER BY` 
* `LIMIT` 
--- 
## 3️⃣ CONSTRAINTS & KEYS (VERY IMPORTANT) 
This is where beginners fail. 
* `PRIMARY KEY` 
* `FOREIGN KEY` 
* `UNIQUE` 
* `NOT NULL` 
* `DEFAULT` 
* `AUTO_INCREMENT` 
Understand: 
* Why constraints exist 
* How they protect data 
--- 
## 4️⃣ JOINS (TOP PLACEMENT TOPIC) 
If you mess this up, you’re rejected. 
* `INNER JOIN` 
* `LEFT JOIN` 
* `RIGHT JOIN` 
* `SELF JOIN` 
* `CROSS JOIN` 
You must understand: 
* Join conditions 
* Cartesian product 
* Difference between `WHERE` vs `ON` 
--- 
## 5️⃣ AGGREGATION & GROUPING (INTERVIEW FAVORITE) 
* `COUNT` 
* `SUM` 
* `AVG` 
* `MIN`, `MAX` 
* `GROUP BY` 
* `HAVING` 
Common traps: 
* `WHERE` vs `HAVING` 
* Grouping with joins 
--- 
## 6️⃣ SUBQUERIES (PLACEMENT + DEV) 
They test **thinking**, not syntax. 
* Subquery in `SELECT` 
* Subquery in `WHERE` 
* Subquery in `FROM` 
* Correlated subqueries 
Know: 
* When subqueries are bad 
* When joins are better 
--- 
## 7️⃣ FUNCTIONS (VERY COMMON) 
### String 
* `CONCAT` 
* `LENGTH` 
* `SUBSTRING` 
* `UPPER`, `LOWER` 
* `TRIM` 
### Numeric 
* `ROUND` 
* `FLOOR` 
* `CEIL` 
### Date 
* `NOW` 
* `CURDATE` 
* `DATEDIFF` 
* `DATE_ADD` 
--- 
## 8️⃣ NORMALIZATION (DEVELOPER SKILL) 
Placements ask theory. Devs need practice. 
* 1NF, 2NF, 3NF 
* Redundant data 
* Functional dependency 
You must be able to: 
* Normalize a bad table 
* Explain why it matters 
--- 
## 9️⃣ INDEXING & PERFORMANCE (DEV LEVEL) 
This separates coders from engineers. 
* What is an index 
* Types of indexes 
* When indexes help 
* When indexes hurt 
* Composite index 
* `EXPLAIN` query 
--- 
## 🔟 TRANSACTIONS (REAL-WORLD CRITICAL) 
Many skip this — don’t. 
* `START TRANSACTION` 
* `COMMIT` 
* `ROLLBACK` 
* ACID properties 
* Dirty read / phantom read (basic understanding) 
--- 
## 1️⃣1️⃣ VIEWS & STORED OBJECTS (GOOD FOR DEV) 
* `VIEW` 
* Stored procedures (basic) 
* Triggers (basic understanding) 
--- 
## 1️⃣2️⃣ SECURITY & USER MANAGEMENT (DEV AWARENESS) 
You don’t need mastery, just awareness. 
* `GRANT` 
* `REVOKE` 
* SQL injection (VERY IMPORTANT) 
* Parameterized queries 
--- 
## 1️⃣3️⃣ REAL-WORLD DATABASE DESIGN (MOST IMPORTANT) 
This is what actually matters. 
You must be able to: 
* Design schema from requirements 
* Decide table relationships 
* Choose primary & foreign keys 
* Avoid redundant data 
--- 
## 1️⃣4️⃣ PRACTICE DATASETS (NON-NEGOTIABLE) 
Theory without data is useless. 
Practice with: 
* E-commerce database 
* Student management 
* Employee & department 
* Orders & payments 
(You already mentioned **ClassicModels** — GOOD. Use it seriously.) 
--- 
## FINAL SCORECARD 
If you complete: 
* Sections **1–6** → **Placement-ready (basic)** 
* Sections **1–9** → **Strong intermediate** 
* Sections **1–14** → **Real developer level** 
--- 
## Brutal truth 
Most people: 
* Learn `SELECT` + `JOIN` 
* Memorize queries 
* Still fail interviews 
Why? 
Because **SQL is about thinking in sets, not syntax**.
