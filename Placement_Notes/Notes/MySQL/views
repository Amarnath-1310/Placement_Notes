1. Create a Database & Table
CREATE DATABASE college;

USE college;

CREATE TABLE students (
    rollno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT,
    gpa FLOAT
);

INSERT INTO students VALUES
(101, 'Ravi', 20, 8.5),
(102, 'Priya', 19, 9.2),
(103, 'Karan', 21, 7.0),
(104, 'Divya', 22, 6.5),
(105, 'Meena', 23, 5.8);

2. Create a Simple View
View that shows only student name and GPA:

CREATE VIEW student_gpa AS
SELECT name, gpa
FROM students;

👉 Now you can use it like a table:
SELECT * FROM student_gpa;


3. Create a Conditional View
View that shows only students with GPA ≥ 7:

CREATE VIEW toppers AS
SELECT rollno, name, gpa
FROM students
WHERE gpa >= 7;

SELECT * FROM toppers;

4. Update Data Through View (if allowed)
Views can sometimes be updated (if they are based on a single table without aggregates).

UPDATE toppers
SET gpa = 9.5
WHERE rollno = 103;

👉 This will also update the students table.

5. Drop a View
DROP VIEW toppers;

🔑 Key Points about Views

Virtual table (no physical data stored).

Simplifies complex queries.

Can provide restricted access to certain columns.

Some views are read-only (cannot update).
