-- Wildcard usage examples
In SQL, wildcards are used with LIKE:

% → zero or more characters
_ → exactly one character
[ ] → any one character from a range/set (SQL Server)
[^ ] or [! ] → not in a set (SQL Server)


-- Create database and table for wildcard examples
CREATE DATABASE WildcardDemo;
USE WildcardDemo;

CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(20)
);

INSERT INTO students VALUES
    (1, 'Amit'),
    (2, 'Ravi'),
    (3, 'Ramesh'),
    (4, 'Chetan'),
    (5, 'Meena'),
    (6, 'Sree'),
    (7, 'Anil'),
    (8, 'Deepa'),
    (9, 'Bala'),
    (10, 'Neel');


1. Starts with a letter
SELECT * FROM students 
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';   -- names starting with A

2. Ends with a letter
SELECT * FROM students 
WHERE name LIKE '%a';   -- names ending with a

3. Contains a sequence
SELECT * FROM students 
WHERE name LIKE '%ee%';   -- names containing 'ee'

4. Single-character wildcard (_)
SELECT * FROM students 
WHERE name LIKE 'R_vi';   -- matches Ravi, but not Ramesh

5. Specific length names
SELECT * FROM students 
WHERE name LIKE '____';   -- names with exactly 4 letters

6. Range with [ ] (SQL Server / MySQL)
SELECT * FROM students 
WHERE name LIKE '[A-C]%';   -- names starting with A, B, or C

7. Not in range (SQL Server)
SELECT * FROM students 
WHERE name LIKE '[^A-C]%';  -- names NOT starting with A, B, or C
