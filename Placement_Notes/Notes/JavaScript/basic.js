// explain the const with example and issues with possible redeclaration, reassignment and block scope
const c = 10;
console.log(c);
// const c = 20; // This will throw an error: Identifier 'c' has already been declared
// c = 20; // This will throw an error: Assignment to constant variable

// explain the block scope with example
if (true) {
    var x = 10; // var is function-scoped, so it will be accessible outside the block
    let y = 20; // let is block-scoped, so it will not be accessible outside the block
    const z = 30; // const is block-scoped, so it will not be accessible outside the block
}
console.log(x); // This will print 10, as var is function-scoped
// console.log(y); // This will throw an error: y is not defined
// console.log(z); // This will throw an error: z is not defined


// In summary:
// - var allows redeclaration and reassignment, and is function-scoped.
// - let does not allow redeclaration but allows reassignment, and is block-scoped.
// - const does not allow redeclaration or reassignment, and is block-scoped.
{
  const d = 40; // const is block-scoped, so it will not be accessible outside the block
  console.log(d); // This will print 40
